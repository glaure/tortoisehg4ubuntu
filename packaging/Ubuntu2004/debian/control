Description: Graphical tool for working with mercurial
 TortoiseHg provides a graphical tool for interacting with the distributed
 revision control system Mercurial.  GUI support is provided for over a
 dozen operations, including add files, commit changes, manage ignore
 filter, view change log, merge, recover/rollback, edit configuration,
 synchronize repository, and many others.   The highlight is the
 interactive commit tool which allows easy selection of diffs from multiple
 files and packaging into changesets, and which is more powerful and easier
 to use than available alternatives such as qct and hgct (commit-tool).
